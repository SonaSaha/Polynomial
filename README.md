# Polynomial
Design and implementation of the Polynomial class.
The class is template class both the coefficient type and the container in which the coefficients are stored are parameterized.
The class supports the basic functionality of addition,subtraction and multiplication,
to_string() member function which would return the string representation of the polynomial in a “normal way".
Class provides begin and end functions for polynomials so that its coefficients can be iterated .
The class provids functions for derivative and integral.
